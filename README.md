# CSS-3D-clickable-flip-cards

Dear Interns,

Welcome aboard! My name is Egon, my team and I will be assigning,monitoring and checking your assignments/projects. In this programme we will be focusing on learning via practicing to code. To complete this Internship you need to submit at least **3 tasks.**

Your first task is to work on **CSS 3D clickable flip cards**. Here you can find the sample **HTML** (structure) and **CSS** (SCSS) styling. To visualize the code you can use the online IDE: [CodePen (https://codepen.io).](https://codepen.io)  Do not forget to change the CSS Preprocessor setting to SCSS (see the settings.png).

We need you to read/understand the code and to use your creativity to design your **own version** of flip cards to promote/advertise a product.

In case of Identical submission your task will not be accepted.

Should you have questions do not hesitate to write us. We are open 24/7.
